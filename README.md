# SideScrollShooter
After I have complited my java class project in one week I had nothing to do for the rest three weeks,
so I desided to play around with Java and to try to build some kind of engine for 2D side scroller shooter.

Controll: WASD to move around, hold SPACE to shoot.
your spaceship has hull health and shield which starts to regenerate if you avoid hits for a while.
